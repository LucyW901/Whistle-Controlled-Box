# Whistle-Controlled-Box
This is a group project credit to Alex Kursell and David Spenler and me.
This is a small box containing an Arduino, battery power supply, microphone, servo and locking mechanism. The box will only unlock itself when the microphone detects a specific tune being whistled. All signal processing and control logic will be performed exclusively on the Arduino.

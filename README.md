# Whistle-Controlled-Box
This is a group project credit to Alex Kursell and David Spenler and me.
This is a small box containing an Arduino, battery power supply, microphone, servo and locking mechanism. The box will only unlock itself when the microphone detects a specific tune being whistled. All signal processing and control logic will be performed exclusively on the Arduino.
This project is done before I created the GutHub project. So all the code is finished in one commit.
My contributions to the project are the fall back ("knock test") and part of the "main_file" final code.
